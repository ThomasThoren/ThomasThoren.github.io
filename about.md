Hello, I am a journalist and web developer working for [The Lens](http://thelensnola.org), a nonprofit investigative newsroom in New Orleans.

You can follow more of what I do on my [Github page](https://github.com/ThomasThoren) or my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thomasjthoren).

Some of my interests include journalism, data, web development, graphics, music, the outdoors and traveling.

Please contact me at thomasjthoren@gmail.com. If you work for a nonprofit, please get in touch about possible pro bono work.

This site was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
