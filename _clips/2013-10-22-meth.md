description: For my master's degree final project, I investigated the ebb and flow of methamphetamine production in Illinois. I wrote the stories and produced the data visualizations and worked with the local NPR and PBS affiliates as they produced follow-up radio and TV pieces. The radio story went on to win the Edward R. Murrow Award for best investigative reporting in a small market (2014).
