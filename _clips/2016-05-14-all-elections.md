description:
  Presented live election results for Louisiana and New Orleans using precinct-level maps. For the past two years, I have been responsible for all data processing and front-end web development. This election coverage has been the subject of a successful crowdfunding campaign and has been sold to news outlets in New Orleans and Louisiana.
