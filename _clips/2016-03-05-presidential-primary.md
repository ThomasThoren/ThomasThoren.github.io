description: Displaying live election results for Louisiana's presidential primary on a precinct-level map of the entire state. This required a healthy amount of data cleaning and geographic processing in order to make sure all 4,000 precincts were accurate and had the same name formats as the Secretary of State's vote results data. This was my first time using D3 in a production environment.
