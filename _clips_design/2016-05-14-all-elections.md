For the past few years, we have published live election results for Louisiana and New Orleans using precinct-level maps. This includes an automated data processing script and front-end visualization of the election data. This election coverage has been the subject of a successful crowdfunding campaign and has been sold to news outlets in New Orleans and Louisiana.
