I combined [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment processing and [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) donor tracking to create a donation system for The Lens. This required combining an Nginx server with an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt to allow for secure, HTTPS traffic. The Lens used this page to accept online donations from 2016 to 2019.
