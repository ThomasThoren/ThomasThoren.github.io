Worked across engineering teams to isolate customer/developer/QA
environments, automate testing in CI pipelines, and increase deployment
confidence for Q2 Software's <a href="https://helix.q2.com/">Helix</a>
organization. This included writing tools for load testing and data
population, as well as self-service tools that allowed developers to
stand up the infrastructure and services for a fully featured
environment in less than 15 minutes.
