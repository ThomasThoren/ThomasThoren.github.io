This is a fully scripted <a href="https://github.com/TheLens/geographic-data">geographic
data-processing pipeline</a> for Louisiana and New Orleans. It combines a Makefile and
command-line tools to download and convert raw geographic data into Shapefile, GeoJSON
and TopoJSON file formats. This was created to eliminate duplicate work and increase
development speed for new graphics.
