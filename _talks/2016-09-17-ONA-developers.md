[Erin Skarda](https://twitter.com/ErinLeighSkarda) and I [discussed](http://ona16.journalists.org/sessions/hiringadeveloper/) our experiences with hiring and including developers in newsrooms. We talked about why they are important, why they are worth the investment and how they can boost the newsroom.
